# My C Programming Journey 🚀

Welcome to my C programming repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn the C language, starting from the basics and moving toward more complex logic.

## 📂 Project List

Here is a breakdown of the mini-projects included in this repository:

### 1. Bio Printer (`01-Bio Printer`)
* **What it does:** A simple program that accepts user input (Name, Age, Department, University) and prints a formatted biography.
* **Key Concepts:** `printf`, `scanf`, and basic String handling.

## 🛠️ How to Run These Codes

If you are using a terminal (Mac/Linux), you can compile and run any of these projects using `gcc`:

1.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd "01-Bio Printer"
    ```

2.  **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    gcc bio.c 
    ```

3.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
